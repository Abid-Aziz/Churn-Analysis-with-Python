# Churn Analysis 

### Overview

I recently conducted a comprehensive analysis focusing on customer churn within a telecom company. 
Using Python and Pandas, I explored various factors that impact customer retention, such as contract types, payment methods, customer tenure, and demographic information.

### Tools

- Python
- Padas
- Matplotlib

###  Key Highlights of My Analysis

- Data Integrity
  
 I ensured data integrity by checking for missing values, with the result showing zero null values across all columns in the dataset. This allowed me to conduct a robust analysis without concerns about incomplete data.

- Factors Impacting Churn

 I discovered significant insights about customer behavior:
Customers on month-to-month contracts had a churn rate of 42% compared to just 3% for those on longer-term contracts. This highlights the importance of long-term commitments in enhancing customer retention.
Payment methods also played a crucial role, with electronic check users exhibiting a churn rate of 45%, indicating possible concerns regarding trust and convenience.
Notably, customers with less than one year of tenure had the highest churn rate at 50%, suggesting a need for targeted engagement strategies for new customers.

- Contract Type
  
 Customers who opt for month-to-month contracts display a higher likelihood of leaving compared to 
those engaged in longer-term contracts such as yearly or bi-annual agreements. Specifically, 42% of 
month-to-month customers are predicted to churn, while the churn rates for yearly and bi-annual 
contracts stand at 11% and 3%, respectively. This suggests that securing long-term commitments can 
enhance customer retention.
- Payment Methods
  
 A considerable number of customers utilizing electronic checks exhibit a higher likelihood of churning 
than those who employ alternative payment options, such as credit cards or bank transfers. The churn 
rate for electronic check users reaches 45%, whereas customers using more traditional payment 
methods experience churn rates between 15% and 18%. This may be attributed to concerns surrounding 
convenience and trust relating to electronic payments.
- Churn Rate by Tenure
  
 Customers with shorter tenures (less than one year) are particularly prone to churning, with a 
significant churn rate of 50%. In contrast, those with tenures of 1-3 years show a lower churn rate of 
35%, while customers who have remained with the company for over three years present a churn rate 
of only 15%. This highlights the importance of effective initial engagement strategies.

### Visualizations
  
Graphs and charts provide visual representations of churn rates across various contract types and 
payment methods, and they show trends concerning customer tenure. These insights underline the 
necessity for customized retention initiatives.

### Comprehensive Executive Summary

#### 1. Contract Type and Churn: 
 - Month-to-month churn: 42% 
 - One-year contract churn: 11% 
 - Two-year contract churn: 3% 
 Insight: Encouraging longer commitment durations can significantly lessen churn rates.
#### 2. Payment Methods and Churn: 
 - Churn rate for electronic checks: 45% 
 - Churn rate for credit card users: 15-18% 
 Insight: Addressing the concerns about electronic payment security and convenience could help lower 
churn.
#### 3. Churn by Tenure: 
 - Churn rate for less than 1 year tenure: 50% 
 - Churn rate for 1-3 years tenure: 35% 
 - Churn rate for more than 3 years tenure: 15% 
 Insight: Prioritizing customer engagement during the initial year is essential for enhancing retention.
#### 4. Churn by Internet Service Type: 
 - Churn rate for Fiber Optic services: 30% 
 - Churn rate for DSL services: 20% 
 Insight: Investigating customer satisfaction related to service quality is vital, particularly for fiber optic 
service users.
#### 5. Senior Citizens and Churn: 
 - Churn rate for senior citizens (65+): 41% 
 - Churn rate for non-senior customers: 26% 
 Insight: Initiating targeted retention programs aimed at senior customers can be an effective strategy 
to mitigate churn.

### Recommendations

#### 1. Encourage Long-Term Contracts: 
 Provide incentives to motivate customers to engage in longer contracts, which could help reduce 
churn.
#### 2. Resolve Payment Method Issues: 
 Launch initiatives that encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to more secure payment 
options.
#### 3. Focus on Early Customer Engagement: 
 Enhance the customer experience for those within their first year of service, as this group shows the 
highest churn rates.
#### 4. Develop Retention Programs for Seniors: 
 Create tailored offers and support specifically designed for the senior demographic to improve 
retention rates
