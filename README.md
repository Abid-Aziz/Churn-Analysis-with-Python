# Churn Analysis 

### Overview

I recently conducted a comprehensive analysis focusing on customer churn within a telecom company. 
Using Python and Pandas, I explored various factors that impact customer retention, such as contract types, payment methods, customer tenure, and demographic information.

### Tools

- Python
- Padas
- Matplotlib

###  Key Highlights of My Analysis

- Data Integrity
  
 I ensured data integrity by checking for missing values, with the result showing zero null values across all columns in the dataset. This allowed me to conduct a robust analysis without concerns about incomplete data.

- Factors Impacting Churn

 I discovered significant insights about customer behavior:
Customers on month-to-month contracts had a churn rate of 42% compared to just 3% for those on longer-term contracts. This highlights the importance of long-term commitments in enhancing customer retention.
Payment methods also played a crucial role, with electronic check users exhibiting a churn rate of 45%, indicating possible concerns regarding trust and convenience.
Notably, customers with less than one year of tenure had the highest churn rate at 50%, suggesting a need for targeted engagement strategies for new customers.

- Visualizations
I utilized bar graphs and line charts to illustrate churn rates across various factors, providing a clear visual insight into data trends. These visual tools are instrumental in identifying areas where retention strategies can be improved.

### Recommendations

Based on my findings, I proposed actionable strategies, including promoting long-term contracts, addressing payment method concerns, and enhancing customer engagement during the initial tenure.
This project not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of customer behavior in the telecom industry. I'm looking forward to applying these insights in practical scenarios and continuing to learn about data-driven decision-making!
